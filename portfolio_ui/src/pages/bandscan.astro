        It's hard to discover local music without sifting through endless social
        media posts, event listings, or unreliable word-of-mouth. Fans often
        miss out on great live music because they don't know what's happening
        nearby. Existing platforms focus on big-name acts, leaving smaller,
        local shows underrepresented.
      </p>
      <p class='mb-10'>
        Bandscan aims to change that, by providing a centralized, easy-to-use
        platform to discover local artists and live music events, so you never
        miss a beat.

      <h2>Timeline and Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        The project had a tight four-month deadline and a small team—consisting
        of a PM, a Lead Developer, and myself as a Designer/Engineer. While the
        small team allowed us to collaborate closely and move quickly, it also
        meant there was a lot of work to go around.
      </p>
      <p>
        I initially joined as the UX/UI designer, refining early research and
        sketches into a functional, user-friendly experience and creating a
        Figma prototype that guided development.
      </p>
      <p class='mb-20'>
        As the design solidified, I transitioned into a frontend engineering
        role, helping to bring the app to life.

        The core feature of the app’s design was inspired by dating apps,
        incorporating a ‘swipe’ functionality that let users browse local artist
        profiles. The goal was to serve two main groups:
      </p>
      <ul class='mb-20'>
        <li>
          <p class='mb-0'><b>1.)</b> Fans looking to discover new music</p>

        likes and upcoming events.

        For the app’s visual design, we aimed for subtlety. The design should

        the experience to feel natural and immersive.
      </p>
      <p>
        As this was an MVP, we prioritized a simple, understated design to
        streamline development. A more refined and fully realized design was
        planned for future iterations.

        The <b>Explore</b> page serves as the core feature of the app, where users
        can discover local artists in their chosen search radius by swiping through
        their profiles. Each artist's profile features an embedded song player for
        quick listening, details about the artist, any upcoming events, and links
        to their social media.
      </p>
      <p class='mb-20'>
        Users can like an artist by clicking the heart icon, which adds the
        artist to the <b>Likes</b> page. Once liked, any upcoming events featuring
        that artist will appear on the
        <b>Events</b> page. To discover more artists, users can navigate to the next
        profile by clicking the arrow.

        Create Artist Profile Mockups
      </figcaption>
      <p>
        Our goal was to make it effortless for artists to create a profile and
        promote themselves. The onboarding process was designed to be simple and
        intuitive, guiding artists through the steps of setting up their
        profile, uploading music, and linking their social media.
      </p>
      <p class='mb-20'>
        In addition to connecting with fans on the Explore page, artists could
        also use the app as a digital <b>Electronic Press Kit (EPK)</b> to share
        with venues and promoters. An EPK is a curated collection of promotional
        materials that helps musicians pitch their work to industry professionals,
        bloggers, and media outlets, providing a structured overview of their music
        and brand.
      </p>
      <!-- Development Section -->
      <h2>Development</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout the design process, I worked closely with the lead developer
        to ensure the designs were technically feasible within our constraints.
        By the time I began frontend development, the app was functional but
        unpolished, with raw JSON data and unstyled components.
      </p>
      <Image src={solidJS} alt='SolidJS logo' class='mx-auto mb-2 w-40' />
      <figcaption class='mb-10 text-center text-sm'>SolidJS Logo</figcaption>
      <p class='mb-20'>
        Using <b>SolidJS</b> and <b>SCSS Modules</b>, I focused on styling the
        interface, creating reusable components, and setting up page navigation
        to improve usability and visual consistency. Other technologies used in
        the project included <b>Supabase</b> for the backend, and <b
          >CapacitorJS</b
        >
        to enable cross-platform functionality across iOS, Android and Web.
      </p>
      <h2>MVP Launch</h2>
      <p>
        The MVP was successfully completed on schedule and the demo made a
        strong debut at the event. The app is now in an early access program and
        is being actively promoted at shows and other music events throughout
        Colorado. Meanwhile, a more polished and fully developed design is in
        progress. For the latest updates, visit <a

      <h2>Insights & Reflection</h2>
      <p class='mb-20'>
        Bandscan was a challenging and rewarding project that pushed me to grow
        as both a designer and developer. It was my first project as an
        independent contractor, where I took an idea from a whiteboard concept
        to a fully functional coded product. The fast-paced timeline and small
        team made for an intense but valuable experience.
