      <p class="mb-10">
        Iâ€™m a Product Designer with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, bringing
        experience from industries like medical devices, mobile commerce, and
        enterprise robotics. My work spans from running clinical usability
        studies to developing comprehensive UI design systems.

        When I'm not working, you can find me out running on the trails and
        scrambling up a rock face or making music in my bedroom and hanging with
        my cats.
