      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        I gained significant experience during my time at Berkshire Grey. As the
        sole designer on the Mobile team, I was allowed to tackle a diverse
        range of tasks giving me valuable hands-on experience with each step of
        the design process.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-20">
        When I transitioned to the Picking Robotics team, I had the chance to
        further broaden my skillset by diving deeper into development, expanding
        my role beyond design into coding and technical implementation. This
        experience greatly enhanced my understanding of both design and
        development workflows.
