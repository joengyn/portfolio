      <p>
        In the summer of 2021, I joined Toast’s “Order & Pay” team during a time
        when the world was still navigating the impacts of the COVID-19
        pandemic. Quarantine restrictions were starting to lift, but
        human-to-human interactions—such as waitstaff serving customers—were
        still seen as risky. In response to this challenge, Toast's "Order &
        Pay" app provided a solution that allowed diners to place and pay for
        their orders via a QR code, minimizing face-to-face contact while still
        providing a restaurant experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The product faced mixed reactions from users. Some embraced the
        convenience and felt that it represented the future of dining
        technology, especially in the context of a pandemic. Others, however,
        felt that this stripped away the personal, human element that many
        people cherish when dining out. The tension between technology and
        tradition created a complex landscape for the app to navigate.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-20">
        My role on the team was multifaceted, involving design, research, and
        user experience improvements. The challenge was not only to refine the
        app but also to address the evolving needs of customers and restaurants
        as the product adapted to a rapidly changing world.
      </p>
      <!-- My Role -->
      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        As a designer on the “Order & Pay” team, my responsibilities were
        divided into two main areas: improving the app's design and conducting
        extensive user research.
      </p>
      <Image src={toastUI} alt="Toast UI image" class="mb-2" />
      <figcaption class="mb-10 text-center text-sm">Toast UI</figcaption>
      <p>
        Mapping the Current State: My first major task was to map out the
        current state of the app. The app had been developed quickly, in
        response to an urgent need, and there was no unified “source of truth”
        for its design or functionality. This led to inconsistencies across the
        product. I worked to catalog the app’s features and design, uncovering
        several small issues with consistency—such as mismatched text and
        components—and addressing them to improve the app’s overall coherence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research & User Studies: I also focused heavily on conducting user
        research to understand the nuances of this new market. The product was
        still evolving, so there were many unknowns. My tasks included: Setting
        up user research studies Recruiting participants Conducting interviews
        both online and in-person Performing ad-hoc research in real-world
        environments (such as observing customers in restaurants) Analyzing and
        presenting data to inform product decisions
      </p>
      <p class="mb-20">
        Through these efforts, I gathered valuable insights about customer
        behaviors and preferences, helping to shape future iterations of the
        app.
      </p>
      <!-- Key Challenges -->
      <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Balancing Technology and Human Interaction: Many users were resistant to
        the idea of using technology to replace personal interactions at
        restaurants. The challenge was not just making the app functional but
        ensuring that it supported the dining experience without alienating
        customers who valued personal service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adapting to Rapid Change: The product was in a fast-moving and
        competitive space, requiring constant iteration and adaptation to
        changing customer expectations and market trends. This made it difficult
        to set long-term strategies but also created an exciting, high-stakes
        environment.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-20">
        Design Consistency: With the product being built rapidly and evolving
        quickly, maintaining design consistency was a key challenge. Ensuring
        that small elements like text styles and button components were aligned
        was crucial for creating a polished, user-friendly experience.
      </p>
      <!-- Learnings -->
      <h2>Learnings</h2>
      <p>
        Working on Toast’s “Order & Pay” app during such a critical and dynamic
        time provided several valuable lessons:
      </p>
      <p>
        Impact of Real-World Observations: Conducting in-person research and
        observing how people interacted with the app and other restaurant
        technology gave me a deeper understanding of human behavior. Seeing
        firsthand how customers responded to technology in the restaurant
        environment reinforced how embedded food service is within cultural
        norms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Navigating the Tension Between Tradition and Innovation: The biggest
        takeaway was learning how to balance technological advancement with the
        preservation of essential human experiences. While some customers
        embraced the convenience of mobile ordering, others wanted to maintain
        personal connections with waitstaff. Finding ways to merge both was key
        to ensuring broader adoption.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-20">
        The Speed of the Food-Tech Industry: The restaurant self-service market
        was rapidly growing, which made it a highly competitive and fast-paced
        field. This environment taught me how to work under pressure, prioritize
        quickly, and adapt to frequent changes in customer needs.
      </p>
      <!-- Conclusion -->
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        My time at Toast was a unique opportunity to work on a product that had
        a tangible impact on people's everyday lives. The “Order & Pay” app was
        at the intersection of technology and tradition, aiming to redefine the
        dining experience. As Toast carved out its place in the competitive
        mobile restaurant space, I gained invaluable insights into design, user
        behavior, and the challenges of innovating in a fast-evolving market.
        The experience reinforced the importance of understanding user needs in
        both the digital and real-world context and helped me grow as a designer
        in the process.
