        In the summer of 2021, as the world was starting to recover from the
        COVID-19 pandemic, I joined the <b>Toast Mobile Order & Pay</b> team. While
        quarantine restrictions were easing, many diners remained cautious about
        in-person interactions, particularly with waitstaff. To address these concerns,
        Toast sought to streamline the dining experience by enabling guests to order
        and pay directly from their phones using a QR code.

      <h2>Role & Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        I joined the team as a <b>UX Design Intern</b>, focusing on improving
        the app’s design and conducting user research.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first major task was to <b>map out the current state of the app</b>.
        Since the product had been developed rapidly in response to an urgent
        need, there was no single “source of truth” for its design or
        functionality. This led to inconsistencies across the product, such as
        mismatched text and components. I cataloged the app’s features,
        identified these inconsistencies, and worked to refine the design for a
        more cohesive user experience.
      </p>
      <Image src={toastUI} alt='Toast UI image' class='case-study-image' />
      <figcaption class='text-center text-sm'>
        Toast Mobile Order & Pay UI
      </figcaption>
      <p>
        Beyond design improvements, I also <b>conducted user research</b> to understand
        this evolving market, where digital ordering and contactless payments were
        becoming more common but not yet fully embraced. Since the product was still
        evolving, there were many unknowns, and gathering real-world insights was
        critical.
      </p>
      <p>My tasks included:</p>
      <ul class='case-study-list'>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class='font-bold'>Setting up user research studies</span> and drafting
            questionnaires
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class='font-bold'>Recruiting participants</span> for interviews
            and usability tests
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class='font-bold'>Conducting interviews</span>, online,
            in-person and via phone
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class='font-bold'>Performing observational research</span> in real-world
            settings, such as restaurants
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class='font-bold'>Analyzing and presenting findings</span> to guide
            product decisions
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class='case-study-section'>
        These efforts provided valuable insights into customer behaviors and
        preferences, shaping future iterations of the app and helping balance
        technology with the dining experience users expected.
      </p>
      <!-- Key Challenges -->
      <h2>Key Challenges</h2>
      <ul class='case-study-list case-study-section'>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class='font-bold'>Balancing Technology and Tradition:</span> The
            product received mixed reactions—some embraced its convenience as the
            future of dining, while others felt it diminished the personal touch
            of eating out.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class='font-bold'>Designing for a B2B2C Model:</span> The app had
            to serve both restaurant owners (B2B) and diners (B2C), balancing ease
            of setup and integration for businesses with a seamless ordering experience
            for customers.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <span class='font-bold'>Competitive Market:</span> With the world eager
            to return to socializing, the restaurant contactless payment market became
            highly competitive. The challenge was to innovate quickly or risk being
            left behind by competitors. Simply having a “right to win” didn’t guarantee
            success.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Learnings & Conclusion -->
      <h2>Learnings & Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        My intership at Toast was a valuable first step in UX Design, teaching
        me how to collaborate across disciplines and design for real-world
        impact. Working on the Order & Pay app during a uniquely dynamic period
        made for an intense, fast-paced experience, where a lot was happening
        despite the short duration of my internship.
      </p>
      <p class='case-study-section'>
        As Toast navigated a competitive market, I gained insights into user
        behavior, product innovation, and the challenges of designing for both
        businesses and consumers. This experience helped me grow as a designer
        and deepened my understanding of creating impactful digital experiences.
